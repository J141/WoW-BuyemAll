If you're reading this file, this means you've manually downloaded a release of BuyEmAll for retail WoW from github for
installation into your WoW client.

To install, copy the BuyEmAll folder that has the BuyEmAll.toc file directly in it, and paste the folder here:
<WoW install directory>\_retail_\Interface\Addons

since WoW 9.0 (Shadowlands), the client no longer needs to restart to detect new addons. just do a /reload and then check
esc -> addons to enable BuyEmAll.
